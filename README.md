# material-selector
Software tool to optimally select a material based on application specifications

This is a project to gain experience with object-oriented programming in C++.

Planned basic features:
  - each material has attributes within a "material" class
    - yield strength
    - ultimate strength
    - shear strength
    - hardness
    - stiffness
    - thermal conductivity
    - electrical conductivity
    - magnetic properties
    - corrosion-resistance
    - price/availability
  - goal is to include variants of most common materials including woods, plastics, aluminums, steels, and some others
  - variable cost function driven by user priorities
